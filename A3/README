INSTRUCTION:
- Undo/Redo Stack
    - Stack starts at index 0
    - The stack does not recognize which joints are selected, it ONLY recognize 
        transformations of JOINTS. Any transformations of puppet is not 
        expected to be recoginized.
    - When some parts are picked, and middle/right mouse button is pressed->released.
        A layer of transformtion will be added to the stack.
        Notice it will still be added even there is NO actuall rotation happen due 
        to reaching limits of rotation.

- Selection or Disselection
    - If joints are selected, they will exist forever unless you manually disselect it.      
        Switching mode, undo/redo, reset have no effects on selected joints.
    - Selected joints do not have special color in Position/Orientation mode, 
        but you can see them once you switch back to Joint mode.
