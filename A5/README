In A5.hpp, comment or uncomment this to enable or disabled corresponding functionality
  * #define RENDER_ANTI_ALIASING
  * #define RENDER_RECURSIVE_RAY_TRACING
  * #define RENDER_MULTITHREADING
  * #define RENDER_PHOTON_MAP
  * #define RENDER_AREA_LIGHT
In PhotonMapper.hpp, comment or uncomment it to enable or disable global photon map
  * #define GLOBAL_PHOTON

PathTracer is default with soft shadow disabled.

To modify material and see how reflection, refraction works, the 4th, 5th position of gr.material is roughness_radius, refractive index
  * roughness < 0.9 -> completely diffuse
  * 0.9 < roughtness < 1 -> glossy reflection/refraction
  * roughness = 1 -> perfect reflection/refraction
  * refractive < 0 -> not refracted
