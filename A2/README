INSTRUCTION:
- The implementation of viewport is based on constant window width and height.
  Resizing window will make viewport behave unusual.
- Changing viewport only appears when user drags a window. Clicking might result in disappearing or weird behaviour of the viewport.
  Please only drag to create new viewport.
